    <h5>It’s very easy to sign up for a new account and claim the subdomain name.

By getting access of a subdomain, an attacker can completely clone of the site, steal valuable credentials like admin accounts (by adding a login form that will redirect the user to a certain page) , steal cookies, or completely destroy the credibility of your company.

It is a covert operation so even the domain owner won’t notice, even your IDS can’t monitor this.

This Vulnerability can lead to other high risk vulnerabilities like Authentication bypass, CORS bypass & many.
